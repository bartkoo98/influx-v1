# Influx - articles about everything - stay closer to your favourite creator!

## About:
*Currently working on another project

Meet my main ongoing project â€“ a Spring-based API that creates a versatile blogging platform that offers a rich feature set for both users and administrators. 
This dynamic system allows users to create and manage articles, comment on them, and categorize their content. With a dual-role system in place, administrators have additional control and privileges.


One of the standout features of this project is its subscription system. Users can subscribe blog, and the system sends automatic email notifications when new articles are posted or when a new user registers.


\* After you successfully launched the project, you can access the path /swagger-ui-doc.html (e.g. http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui-doc.html) and see full swagger documentation.

## What I used?
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Framework(Data JPA, Validation, Security)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Junit, Assertj, Mockito
- Maven
- Lombok
- OpenAPI Swagger

## How to run:
Clone the repository and run ```docker-compose up``` in the terminal in this directory.

## Soon:
* Application logs
* More Unit and Integration Tests
* Cache
* Improved registration system
* Corrections in subscription and mail sender
